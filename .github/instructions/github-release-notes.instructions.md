# GitHub Release Notes Instructions

This document provides comprehensive instructions for creating professional, well-structured GitHub release notes for the DevLog application. Release notes are published in two formats: a **detailed version** and a **summary version**.

## File Naming and Location

### Detailed Release Notes

- **Filename:** `release-vX.X.X.md`
- **Location:** `docs/published/`
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive documentation of all changes with code examples, technical details, and migration guidance

### Summary Release Notes

- **Filename:** `release-vX.X.X.summary.md`
- **Location:** `docs/published/`
- **Purpose:** Condensed version highlighting key changes for quick review

## Release Type Determination

Determine the release type based on semantic versioning and commit messages:

### Patch Release (x.x.X)

- Bug fixes (`fix:`)
- Documentation updates (`docs:`)
- Minor code quality improvements
- Non-breaking changes
- **Example:** v18.31.1, v18.31.3

### Minor Release (x.X.0)

- New features (`feat:`)
- Enhancements to existing features
- New components or utilities
- Non-breaking additions
- **Example:** v18.29.0, v18.31.0

### Major Release (X.0.0)

- Breaking changes (`BREAKING CHANGE:`)
- API changes requiring migration
- Major architectural changes
- **Example:** v19.0.0

---

## Detailed Release Notes Structure

### Required Sections

#### 1. Title and Metadata

```markdown
# Release Notes: vX.X.X

**Release Date:** Month DD, YYYY
```

**Rules:**
- Use H1 heading for title
- Include version number with `v` prefix
- Release date in bold, format: "Month DD, YYYY"
- No emojis in the H1 title

---

#### 2. Overview (## 🎉 Overview)

**Purpose:** Provide high-level summary of the release focus and impact

**Structure:**

- Explain what changed and why
- Describe overall impact

**Template:**

```markdown
## 🎉 Overview

This [patch/minor/major] release [primary focus/goal]. [Additional context about the changes].

[Impact statement and benefits overview].
```

**Example:**

```markdown
## 🎉 Overview

This patch release fixes utility export issues and improves code consistency by consolidating exports and updating function syntax. The primary change resolves missing utility exports from the main library entry point, ensuring all utilities introduced in v18.31.0 are properly accessible to consumers.
```

### Code Blocks

**Requirements:**
- Always specify language: ```tsx```, ```typescript```, ```bash```
